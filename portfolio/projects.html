<h2>Projects:</h2> 
<ol>
 <li>My biggest project right now is my yard. I hope to create space for an urban flower farm, where I hope to sell local flowers to
consumers and florists. Hoping I can use some of the tools and information I learn in this course to help me create a webpage for my business.</li>
 <li>When I worked at Brandes Associates, I worked on projects where we gathered mission data (weather and intelligence) for Navy SEALS that were planning 
missions.  </li>
<li>Winter sememster I re-took CS 142, and worked on lots of fun projects, like the bakery ordering system.</li>
