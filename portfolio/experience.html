<h2>Experience:</h2> <p>While I was an undergraduate at BYU I worked as a TA for CS 143, CS 380, and a research assistant for Dr. Kelly Flanagan and 
Dr. Michael Goodrich.  Upon graduation, I worked for a small milatry contractor where we developed mission planning software for the Navy SEALS.  
In 2003 I had my first son, and have been a stay at home mom since then.
